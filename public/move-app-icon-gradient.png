This is a placeholder for the gradient app icon. To create the actual icon:

1. Start with the original app icon image from https://cdn.midjourney.com/c5cdbe2a-8d65-4eae-a252-4db3a6b23553/0_0.png
2. Open the image in an image editing software like Photoshop or GIMP.
3. Add a new layer on top of the icon.
4. Create a gradient overlay using colors similar to those used in the group cards (e.g., from blue to purple, or from green to blue).
5. Set the blend mode of the gradient layer to "Overlay" or "Soft Light" to allow the original icon details to show through.
6. Adjust the opacity of the gradient layer to achieve the desired effect (around 50-70% usually works well).
7. Export the image as a PNG file named "move-app-icon-gradient.png" and replace this placeholder file.
